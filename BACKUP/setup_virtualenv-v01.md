# Virtual Environment with Conda

A virtual environment keeps your tools and packages isolated, ensuring your analysis is reproducible.

## âœ… Key Commands

- Create a new environment:

```bash
      conda create -n geocat -c conda-forge geocat-comp geocat-viz
```

- Activate the environment:

```bash
      conda activate geocat
```

- Deactivate when done:

```bash
      conda deactivate
```

You can create different environments for other tasks or courses. Use `conda env list` to view all environments on your system.
