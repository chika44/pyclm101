# Data Analysis

This chapter introduces common techniques for analyzing climate data using Python. We'll build on the file input examples and learn how to:

- Subset data by time, space, and variable
- Compute spatial and temporal averages
- Apply basic climate statistics such as anomalies or trends

These methods will prepare you to interpret and summarize large climate datasets.
