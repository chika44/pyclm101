In this chapter, you'll learn how to create plots to explore and communicate climate data.

We'll introduce:

- Basic 1D and 2D plots using `matplotlib`
- Quick visualization tools in `xarray`
- Geospatial plots with `cartopy`

Good visualizations are key to understanding complex datasets and sharing insights effectively.
